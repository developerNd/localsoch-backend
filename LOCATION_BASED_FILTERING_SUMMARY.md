# Location-Based Product Filtering Summary

## Technical Implementation

### Location Filter Structure
```javascript
// Base URL
let url = `${API_URL}/api/products?populate=*`;

// Add location filters
if (selectedLocation && selectedLocation.pincode) {
  url += `&filters[location][pincode]=${selectedLocation.pincode}`;
  
  if (selectedLocation.city) {
    url += `&filters[location][city]=${encodeURIComponent(selectedLocation.city)}`;
  }
  
  if (selectedLocation.state) {
    url += `&filters[location][state]=${encodeURIComponent(selectedLocation.state)}`;
  }
}
```

### Hook Usage Pattern
```javascript
const { selectedLocation } = useLocation();

useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedLocation) {
    fetchData(); // Refetch when location changes
  }
}, [selectedLocation]);
```

## Test Results
